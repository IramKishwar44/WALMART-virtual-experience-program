# WALMART-virtual-experience-program
Completed the Advanced Software Engineering Job Simulation where I solved some technical projects for a variety of teams at Walmart.

Your task is to draft a UML class diagram describing the data processors for a pipeline. The component responsible for reading in input data is being designed by another engineer, so you only need to worry about what happens to the data when it reaches your processor. 

You may assume three classes already exist:

Datapoint: this class represents both raw and processed data points. Any time data moves between methods you may use this class as an abstraction.
ModeIdentifier: an enum used to identify a processor mode.
DatabaseIdentifier: an enum used to identify a database connection.
